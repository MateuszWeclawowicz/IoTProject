# IoTProject
This project is to help prevent babies overheating in their rooms.
This is a worldwide problem where the room is too hot for a baby and our project aims to tackle that problem.
The parents of a child might be working from home or cooking so they can't monitor their baby all the time when it is asleep,
we aim to have a device that detects the temperature of the room and cools down the room to an ideal temperature for the baby so that
there is no harm done and to make the life of parents a little bit easier.
